# The site is launched!

___

Hey, comrades! This is the first publication of a newly launched <u>Ighu!Studio</u> website!

## So, what is it?

Ighu!Studio is a free international art community. We create and distribute free works of art, such as music, literature, computer games, etc. We aim to support any freedom of expression on the Internet and strive to achieve this.

## What does "free" mean?

<u>Free</u> or <u>open source</u> artworks and software are digital products that you have the right to have, distribute and edit in any way. Every product of Ighu!Studio is licensed under a CC0 license, so we do not claim any rights to it. We are just an instrument to share things we create.

## Why Esperanto?

<u>Esperanto</u> is an international planned language, created in 1887 by the Polish linguist Ludovic Zamenhof, currently being a neutral language of a large linguistic minority. Using it as the main language of our products and the website itself, we popularize it as a powerful tool for expression and communication, whose usefulness is shown in its simplicity and universality.
